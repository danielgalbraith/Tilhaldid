R script for ordered logit regression model of Faroese speaker judgements on quirky case sentences

This repository contains an analysis of the results of a survey on Faroese quirky case sentences.

* <b>tilhaldid.r</b>: R script containing code for plot using ggplot and model using ordinal library and clmm
* <b>tilhaldid.csv</b>: Contains sentence judgement data from the Faroese survey
* <b>sentence-plot.png</b>: Plot generated by analysis.r

The ordered logit regression model is implemented in clmm, and can be summarised thus:

acceptability ~ object case + (1|speaker) + (1|item)
